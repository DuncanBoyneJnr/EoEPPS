Duncan is a Power BI Consultant who believes every messy Excel sheet deserves a second chance. Known as the Power BI Kinda Guy, he spends his days transforming chaos into clean visuals and his evenings building community through the Norfolk Power Platform User Group. When he's not deep in DAX, you'll probably find him turning data jokes into LinkedIn carousels or planning the next big event for the Power Platform community.
