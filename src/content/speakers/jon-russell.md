Jon is a Senior Power Platform Technical Consultant at Capgemini with over 20 years of experience in IT and a strong focus on helping others grow in the Microsoft ecosystem. He's passionate about building communities where people can learn, share, and thrive together. Jon runs mentoring programs, contributes to user groups, and was previous co-host of the Sprint Zero podcast, which brought fresh voices and perspectives from across the Power Platform world.

For Jon, the Power Platform isn't just about technology — it's about people, collaboration, and creating opportunities. Whether mentoring new consultants, organising events, or connecting with peers, having recently been diagnosed with ADHD he's always working to make the community stronger and more inclusive.

Jon will be looking after the speakers side of things for EoEPPS. Jon's go-to tools are a solid data model, rapport building, radical candor and a dose of humour.
